Controls:

click with LMB: add an asteroid of mass 10 to the simulation 
with random +-10 velocity in x and y directions

T: enable/disable trails(helps with performance)
C: clear to initial conditions
Space: pause
Plus: speed up time by (dt*1.1)
Minus: slow down time by (dt/1.1)

----------PRESETS----------
1: Two start system of equal masses
2: Circular orbit of a star and planetoid
3: 3 Body unstable orbit
4: Collision Between 2 stars restricted to x axis (shows conservation of momentum)
5: Black hole(Star with very high mass)
